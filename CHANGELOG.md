# Changelog

All notable, user-visible changes to Persia DB are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). On-disk format versions are tracked separately
(SPEC §15) and are called out under **Format**, a project-specific section added to the standard ones.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Workspace skeleton (stub crates).
- Apache-2.0 license.

### Format
- Integer codecs for segment sections (SPEC §4.1, §5.2.1; ADR-0004): zigzag signed varints, delta coding of
  sorted docids, 128-value bit-packed blocks (SIMD-BP128 layout), postings full and tail blocks, and
  frame-of-reference blocks with order-preserving keys for numeric columns.
- Checksum and hash primitives (SPEC §4.1): CRC32C (one-shot and streaming), xxh3-64/128 (seed 0), and
  `Checksummed<T>` for fixed-size structures whose CRC32C field covers the rest of the region (SPEC §4.2, §4.3).
- Block codecs (SPEC §5.2; ADR-0005): codec byte `0 = None`, `1 = Zstd` (one zstd frame with declared content
  size), with a decompression-bomb guard on every decode.
- Block framing of segment sections (SPEC §5.2; ADR-0006): 16-byte block header (CRC32C, codec, lengths), fixed-size
  blocks over a byte stream, and a CRC-protected block table that records the block size (the bomb limit) and
  each block's end; corrupt blocks are reported with their index. The section table has no `codec` field.
